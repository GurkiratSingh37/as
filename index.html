  <h1 class="heading1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel">Time Travel</a></h1>
  <p class="paragraph1">Time travel is the concept of movement between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space by an object or a person,
    typically with the use of a hypothetical device known as a time machine. Time travel is a widely recognized concept in philosophy and fiction.
    It is uncertain if time travel to the past is physically possible. Forward time travel, outside the usual sense of the perception of time,
    is an extensively observed phenomenon and well-understood within the framework of special relativity and general relativity.</p>

  <p class="paragraph2">A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing—no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from it.
    The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which
    no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it,
    it has no locally detectable features. In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.</p>

  <h1 class="heading3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity">Gravity</a></h1>
  <p class="paragraph3">Gravity (from Latin gravitas, meaning 'weight'), or gravitation, is a natural phenomenon by which all things with mass or energy—including planets, stars,
    galaxies, and even light are brought toward (or gravitate toward) one another. On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects, and the Moon's gravity causes the ocean tides.
    The gravitational attraction of the original gaseous matter present in the Universe caused it to begin coalescing and forming stars and caused the stars to group together into galaxies,
    so gravity is responsible for many of the large-scale structures in the Universe. Gravity has an infinite range, although its effects become increasingly weaker as objects get further away.</p>

  <h1 class="heading4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity">General Theory Of Relativity </a></h1>
  <p class="paragraph4">General relativity (GR), also known as the general theory of relativity (GTR), is the geometric theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915
    and the current description of gravitation in modern physics. General relativity generalizes special relativity and refines Newton's law of universal gravitation,
    providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time, or spacetime. In particular, the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the
    energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present. The relation is specified by the Einstein field equations, a system of partial differential equations.</p>

  <h1 class="heading5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave#:~:text=Gravitational%20waves%20are%20disturbances%20in,at%20the%20speed%20of%20light.">Gravitational Waves</a></h1>
  <p class="paragraph5">Gravitational waves are disturbances in the curvature of spacetime, generated by accelerated masses, that propagate as waves outward from their source at the speed of light.
    They were proposed by Henri Poincaré in 1905 and subsequently predicted in 1916 by Albert Einstein on the basis of his general theory of relativity.
    Gravitational waves transport energy as gravitational radiation, a form of radiant energy similar to electromagnetic radiation. Newton's law of universal gravitation,
    part of classical mechanics, does not provide for their existence, since that law is predicated on the assumption that physical interactions propagate instantaneously (at infinite speed) –
    showing one of the ways the methods of classical physics are unable to explain phenomena associated with relativity.</p>
